# What is BillioCarâ„¢?
This project is for absolute beginers who want to learn how to build a robotic car from zero. Throughout this project, you will study Nvidia Jetson Nano and learn about python coding, Jupyter notebook, 3d printing, electronics and basic AI knowledge about object detection and self-driving.

## Build, Play and Learn AI!
We are entering the age of artificial intelligence. AI is gradually changing every aspect of our living. Let's learn how it really work through this project, BillioCar, to build your own robotic car, step by step.

This project aims to be designed friendly for absolute beginers, at the same time, be chanlleging for people who already know some baisc python coding and remote control car, for further improvement on AI knowledge and application.

## Quick Guide
#### Controlling the car through widgets in Jupyter Notebook ####

## Donate
This project is developed on a non-commercial basis by Open Source enthusiasts. \
If you find __*billiocar*__ useful, you can support the lead developer by donating a few dollars via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/BillyYBWang).
With this money, we will be able to buy new hardware to test and do more such project for open source and for free education, and generally devote significantly more time to these projects.
